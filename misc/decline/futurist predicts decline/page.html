‘founding father’ of peace and conflict studies as a scientific discipline. He has made numerous accurate predictions of major world events, most notably the collapse of the Soviet Empire<br/>
<br/>
Galtung has also accurately predicted the 1978 Iranian revolution; the Tiananmen Square uprising of 1989 in China; the economic crises of 1987, 2008 and 2011; and even the 9/11 attacks<br/>
<br/>
TODO relate this to McLuhan tetrad: decades ago developed a theory of “synchronizing and mutually reinforcing contradictions”, which he used to make his forecasts. The model was based on comparing the rise and fall of 10 historical empires.<br/>

<br/>
In the case of the USSR, the main structural contradictions were as follows: the working class was increasingly repressed and unable to self-organise through trade unions (ironic given the country’s Communist pretensions); the wealthier ‘bourgeoisie’ or elite had money to spend, but nothing to buy from domestic production, leading to economic stagnation; Russian intellectuals wanted more freedom of expression; minorities wanted more autonomy; and peasants wanted more freedom of movement<br/>
The model works like this: the more those contradictions deepen, the greater the likelihood they will result in a social crisis that could upend the existing order<br/>

15 structural contradictions his model identifies as driving the decline, are:<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;economic contradictions such as ‘overproduction relative to demand’, unemployment and the increasing costs of climate change; </li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;military contradictions including rising tensions between the US, NATO, and its military allies, along with the increasing economic unsustainability of war; </li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;political contradictions including the conflicting roles of the US, UN and EU; </li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;cultural contradictions including tensions between US Judeo-Christianity, Islam, and other minorities; </li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;and social contradictions encompassing the increasing gulf between the so-called ‘American Dream’, the belief that everyone can prosper in America through hard work, and the reality of American life (the fact that more and more people can’t).</li>
</ul>
