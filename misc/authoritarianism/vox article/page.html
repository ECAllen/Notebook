That year, Hetherington and Weiler published a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Authoritarianism-Polarization-American-Politics-Hetherington/dp/052171124X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1456938606&sr=8-1&keywords=hetherington+weiler+authoritarianism">book</a>&nbsp;about the effects of authoritarianism on American politics<br/>
<br/>
At the time, even Hetherington and Weiler did not realize the explosive implications: that their theory, when followed to its natural conclusion, predicted a looming and dramatic transformation of American politics. But looking back now, the ramifications of their research seem disturbingly clear.<br/>
<br/>
Authoritarians are thought to express much deeper fears than the rest of the electorate, to seek the imposition of order where they perceive dangerous change, and to desire a strong leader who will defeat those fears with force. <br/>
<br/>
To answer that question, these theorists study what they call authoritarianism: not the dictators themselves, but rather the psychological profile of people who, under the right conditions, will desire certain kinds of extreme policies and will seek strongman leaders to implement them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Feldman developed what has since become widely accepted as the definitive measurement of authoritarianism: four simple questions that appear to ask about parenting but are in fact designed to reveal how highly the respondent values hierarchy, order, and conformity over other values.<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;Please tell me which one you think is more important for a child to have: independence or respect for elders?</li>
<li>Please tell me which one you think is more important for a child to have: obedience or self-reliance?</li>
<li>Please tell me which one you think is more important for a child to have: to be considerate or to be well-behaved?</li>
<li>Please tell me which one you think is more important for a child to have: curiosity or good manners?</li>
</ul>
<br/>
The third insight came from Hetherington and American University professor Elizabeth Suhay, who <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00514.x/abstract">found</a>&nbsp;that when non-authoritarians feel sufficiently scared, they also start to behave, politically, like authoritarians.<br/>

<br/>
This, Feldman explained to me, is "classic authoritarian leadership style: simple, powerful, and punitive."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If Trump loses the election, that will not remove the threats and social changes that trigger the "action side" of authoritarianism. The authoritarians will still be there. They will still look for candidates who will give them the strong, punitive leadership they desire.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
And that means Donald Trump could be just the first of many Trumps in American politics, with potentially profound implications for the country.<br/>
