<b>Ch3 How to Model Services</b><br/>
<br/>
What makes a good service?<br/>
<ul><li style="list-style-type: none">loose coupling - change in one service does not require change in another service</li>
</ul>
<ul><li style="list-style-type: none">high cohesion - related behaviour together, unrelated behaviour elsewhere</li>
</ul>
<ul><li style="list-style-type: none">bounded context - models,objects that do not need to be communicated outside as well as models that are shared externally. You communicate with it's explicit boundary using models. Reference Domain-Driven Design.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>Ch 4 Integration</b><br/>
<br/>
Synchromnous vs Asynchronous<br/>
<br/>
Orchestration vs Choreography <br/>
<ul><li style="list-style-type: none">orchestration - central process directs the app</li>
</ul>
<ul><li style="list-style-type: none">choreography - each part knows it's job and they work out the details</li>
</ul>
<br/>
RPC vs REST<br/>
<br/>
RPC - technique of making local call and having it execute a remote service. <br/>
<br/>
RPC downsides<br/>
<ul><li style="list-style-type: none">networks arent reliable which can be a problem when coding as if remote service is local call</li>
</ul>
<ul><li style="list-style-type: none">brittleness - clients become dependent on implementations on the server, changes on the server require changes on the client ( tight coupling )</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"></li>
</ul>
