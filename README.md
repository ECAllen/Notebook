KeepNote Notebook files

I like to keep notes using a program called (Keepnote)[http://keepnote.org/manual/]. The nice thing about it is that it stores the notes in html.

These are misc notes that are probably only useful to me but may be relevant for others. These are also integrated into my homepage (ECAllen)[http://ecallen.com].
